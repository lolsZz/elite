EXAMPLES:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT: Kill the process running on port 3000

RESPONSE:
Thinking Section:
- Analyze: Need to terminate a process using a specific port
- Relevant libraries: os (for system commands)
- Plan: Use lsof to find the process ID, then kill it
- Reasoning: This approach works across different Unix-like systems

Script Generation:
```python
import os
import subprocess

def kill_process_on_port(port: int) -> None:
    try:
        # Find the process ID using the port
        result = subprocess.run(['lsof', '-ti', f':{port}'], capture_output=True, text=True)
        pid = result.stdout.strip()
        
        if pid:
            # Kill the process
            os.kill(int(pid), 9)
            print(f"Process on port {port} has been terminated.")
        else:
            print(f"No process found running on port {port}.")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        print(f"Error: Unable to find process on port {port}.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: Insufficient permissions to kill process on port {port}.")

# Execute the function
kill_process_on_port(3000)
```

Reflection Section:
- The script uses subprocess for better control and error handling
- It includes error checking for process not found and permission issues
- The function is reusable for different ports

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT: Rename the photos in this directory with "nyc" and their timestamp

RESPONSE:
Thinking Section:
- Analyze: Need to rename image files with a prefix and timestamp
- Relevant libraries: os, time
- Plan: List image files, create new names with prefix and timestamp, rename files
- Reasoning: Use list comprehension for efficiency, handle potential errors

Script Generation:
```python
import os
import time
from typing import List

def rename_photos(prefix: str) -> None:
    # List comprehension to get image files
    image_files: List[str] = [f for f in os.listdir('.') if f.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif'))]
    
    for file in image_files:
        try:
            # Get file modification time
            timestamp = time.strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S', time.localtime(os.path.getmtime(file)))
            # Create new filename
            new_name = f"{prefix}_{timestamp}{os.path.splitext(file)[1]}"
            # Rename file
            os.rename(file, new_name)
            print(f"Renamed: {file} -> {new_name}")
        except OSError as e:
            print(f"Error renaming {file}: {e}")

# Execute the function
rename_photos("nyc")
```

Reflection Section:
- The script uses type hints for better clarity
- It includes error handling for potential OS errors during renaming
- The function is reusable with different prefixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT: Summarize my essay

RESPONSE:
Thinking Section:
- Analyze: Need to read an essay file and generate a summary
- Relevant libraries: glob (for file finding), nltk (for text processing)
- Plan: Find the essay file, read its content, use NLTK for summarization
- Reasoning: This is a two-step process requiring the CONTINUE mechanism

Script Generation (Step 1):
```python
import glob
from typing import List

def find_and_read_essay() -> str:
    try:
        # Find essay files
        essay_files: List[str] = glob.glob("*essay*.*")
        if not essay_files:
            return "No essay files found."
        
        # Read the first found essay file
        with open(essay_files[0], "r") as f:
            content = f.read()
        
        print(f"Essay file found: {essay_files[0]}")
        print("Content preview:")
        print(content[:500] + "..." if len(content) > 500 else content)
        return content
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error reading essay: {str(e)}"

# Execute the function and prepare for the next step
essay_content = find_and_read_essay()
print("CONTINUE")
```

Reflection Section:
- The script handles potential file reading errors
- It provides a preview of the essay content for verification
- The CONTINUE mechanism is used to proceed to the summarization step

Script Generation (Step 2):
```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize
from typing import List

def summarize_essay(content: str, num_sentences: int = 3) -> str:
    try:
        # Download necessary NLTK data
        nltk.download('punkt', quiet=True)
        nltk.download('stopwords', quiet=True)

        # Tokenize the text into sentences
        sentences: List[str] = sent_tokenize(content)

        # Calculate word frequencies
        stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
        word_frequencies = {}
        for word in word_tokenize(content.lower()):
            if word not in stop_words:
                word_frequencies[word] = word_frequencies.get(word, 0) + 1

        # Calculate sentence scores
        sentence_scores = {}
        for sentence in sentences:
            for word in word_tokenize(sentence.lower()):
                if word in word_frequencies:
                    sentence_scores[sentence] = sentence_scores.get(sentence, 0) + word_frequencies[word]

        # Get top sentences
        summary_sentences = sorted(sentence_scores, key=sentence_scores.get, reverse=True)[:num_sentences]
        summary = ' '.join(summary_sentences)

        return f"Essay Summary:\n\n{summary}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error summarizing essay: {str(e)}"

# Execute the summarization
print(summarize_essay(essay_content))
```

Reflection Section:
- The script uses NLTK for advanced text processing
- It implements a basic extractive summarization technique
- The summary length is customizable (default 3 sentences)
